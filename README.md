This fork of JoeyNMT was created as a term project by Christoph Schneider.
It implements Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning.
To recreate the work described in the accompanying term paper, please install this version of joeynmt as described here:
	https://joeynmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
Please make sure to clone this GitHub repository instead of the original JoeyNMT repository.
Then follow the training instructions described here:
	https://joeynmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#training
The config file for normal ConvSeq2Seq is called convSeq2Seq_iwslt14_bpe.yaml
The config file for ConvSeq2Seq with Multi Head attention is called convSeq2Seq_iwslt14_multihead_bpe.yaml
Please note that so far only GPU training is implemented.
